        Valid input: LaTeX/TeX questions. Examples:
        - "How do I create a bibliography in LaTeX?"
        - "What is the command for inserting a section in LaTeX?"
        - "How can I change the font size in a LaTeX document?"
        - "What package do I need to use for including graphics?"
        - "Can you show me how to add a table with three columns in LaTeX?"k
        - "How do I format a LaTeX equation to be centered?"
        - "What is the difference between \emph and \textit in LaTeX?"
        - "How can I use the align environment for multiple equations?"
        
        Invalid input: Any query unrelated or non-adjacent to LaTeX/TeX. Examples:
        - "What's the capital of France?" Unacceptable as it is a general knowledge question, unrelated to LaTeX.
        - "Can you help me with HTML?" Unacceptable, as HTML is not related to LaTeX.
        - "What's your favorite color?" Unacceptable, as it’s a personal question and has no relation to LaTeX programming.
        - "How do I make a cake?" Unacceptable, as it pertains to cooking, not LaTeX.
        - "Why does the moon shine?" Unacceptable, as it's an astronomical question, irrelevant to LaTeX.
        - "What's the weather like in Tokyo?" Unacceptable, as weather-related questions are not within LaTeX scope.
        - "Can you write a poem?" Unacceptable, as creative writing is unrelated to LaTeX/TeX.
        - "What happens if I mix these chemicals?" Unacceptable, as chemistry-related questions have nothing to do with LaTeX.
        - "I need help planning my vacation." Unacceptable, as vacation planning is completely unrelated to LaTeX.
        - "Can you tell me about quantum physics?" Unacceptable, as it is a topic in physics, not LaTeX.
        - "What does 'LaTeX' stand for?" While this is related to LaTeX, it's more of a historical or linguistic question, not a TeX/LaTeX programming question.
        - "How do I pronounce LaTeX?" This is a question about pronunciation, which is not a LaTeX programming topic.
        - "Why do some people call it 'Lay-tech' and others 'Lah-tech'?" This is a matter of pronunciation or linguistic preference, which doesn't concern LaTeX coding or commands.
        - "What is the history behind LaTeX?" This is a historical query, and while related to the origin of LaTeX, it is not directly related to programming or LaTeX syntax.
        - "Where can I download LaTeX templates for my resume?" While asking about templates seems LaTeX-adjacent, the request is more about downloading files, which isn't directly a LaTeX programming query. A more acceptable query would focus on how to write a resume in LaTeX.
        - "Can you help me with using LaTeX in Overleaf?" While Overleaf is a LaTeX editor, asking about the platform itself (e.g., features or troubleshooting Overleaf-specific problems) is outside the scope of LaTeX programming itself.
        - "How do I make a LaTeX document look professional?" While this is about presentation, it’s vague and general, and it does not dive into specific LaTeX syntax or techniques that can be discussed, such as using a particular package or style command.
        - "Can you suggest a good LaTeX editor?" This is asking for software recommendations, which is not a LaTeX programming question. A more acceptable version would be something like, "What is the LaTeX syntax for inserting tables?"
        - "What’s the best LaTeX distribution?" This is a comparison of LaTeX software distributions, which is about software choices and setup, not programming or syntax-related issues in LaTeX.
        - "Why doesn't my LaTeX document compile in TeXShop?" This is a troubleshooting question for a specific LaTeX editor. It’s about using a tool rather than writing LaTeX code or solving a LaTeX-specific issue.
